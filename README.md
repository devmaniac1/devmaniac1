👨‍💻 Passionate Computer Science Student & Tech Enthusiast

👋 Hello There! I'm Ashfaq, a passionate computer science student with a knack for problem-solving and a love for exploring the vast realms of technology.

🎓 Currently diving deep into the world of computer science, I'm honing my skills in various areas including MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), Java, JavaScript, Python, and the art of penetration testing.

💻 Whether it's crafting robust web applications with MERN or delving into the intricacies of algorithms with Java, I'm always eager to learn and push the boundaries of my knowledge.

🔍 When I'm not coding, you can find me delving into cybersecurity challenges, sharpening my penetration testing skills to fortify digital defenses.

🌟 Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects! Together, let's build, innovate, and make a positive impact on the world through technology.
